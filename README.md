R Scraping and preliminary cleaning script for US lobbying disclosures

## Note
All observations are scraped from "https://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm".
Given these lobbying disclosures are provided as xml-files, the creation of the final dataset takes substantial time (read: a couple of days).
