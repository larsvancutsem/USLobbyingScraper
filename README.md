# USLobbyingScraper
R Scraping and preliminary cleaning script for US lobbying disclosures

## Note
This scraper retrieves all observations from "https://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm". The site will soon (31/12/2021) convert to a REST API, hence this code might be obsolete soon. Given these lobbying disclosures are provided as xml-files, the creation of the final dataset takes substantial time (read: a couple of days).
